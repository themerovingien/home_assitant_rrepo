# Home Assistant Add-on: ProtonMail Bridge addon


![Supports amd64 Architecture][amd64-shield]
![Supports armv7 Architecture][armv7-shield]

[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE.md)

ProtonMail does not provide any SMTP server to integrate with the notification
system of Home Assistant. Instead they provide a tool called the ProtonMail 
Bridge.

This bridge should be installed locally and act as a local SMTP server on 
which we should connect Home Assistant to send notifications.

This bridge is responsible to encrypt emails before sending them to the
ProtonMail server.

## Installation

You can install this Home Assistant add-on using 
[my add-on repository](https://github.com/fboulay/ha-addons-repository) 
following these 
[Home Assistant Add-on Instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/).

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration when directly editing yaml:

```yaml
username: <my_proton_mail_username>
password: <my_proton_mail_password>
two_factor_code: ""
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `username`

Enter you ProtonMail username in this field.

### Option: `password`

Enter you ProtonMail password in this field.

A security check is made on the password when the addon is starting. The
check is searching the password i the HaveIBeenPwned database. If the
password is considered unsafe, a warning is displayed in the logs.

### Option: `two_factor_code`

Use it only if enabled on your ProtonMail account.

The management of the 2nd factor code (TOTP) is really simple and can lead to 
failed authentication. Each code has a lifespan of 30 seconds. Thus the 
time when entering the code in the configuration, and the time when the addon 
is started should be has short as possible.

## Configuring Home Assistant to send notification using ProtonMail Bridge

Add this in your `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
notify:
  - name: ProtonMail
    platform: smtp
    sender: <your_protonmail_email_address>
    recipient: email_address_of_recipient
    server: 22fd13a0-pmb
    port: 25
    encryption: none
    username: <your_protonmail_bridge_username>
    password: <generated_protonmail_bridge_password>
```

### Option: `username` and `password`

The username is one of your mail address. The one to use is visible in the logs 
of this addon in the supervisor.

You must use the password generated by the ProtonMail Bridge, 
not your ProtonMail password. To see this password, check the logs of the addon in the 
supervisor.

### Option: `server`

Should be always set to `22fd13a0-pmb`

### Option: `sender`

Use one of your ProtonMail address to send the notification.

### Other options

All other options are explained in the documentation of the [SMTP integration][smtp].

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on only works on `armv7` and `amd64` architectures, because it could 
not be tested on other architectures.
- This add-on is using an old version of the ProtonMail Bridge (1.4.5) because of 
  some bugs on `armv7` architecture on later versions. See
https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/jvzm12/issue_building_bridge_150/

### Error messages explained

The logs can show some errors. The common errors are explained here:

* `Bad 2FA code` Your 2nd factor code is wrong. Fix the `two_factor_code` in the configuration and restart
  the addon.
* `Bad username or password` The authentication has failed. Fix the `username` or the `password` in the 
  configuration and restart the addon.
* `Cannot connect - Please check errors above` Some errors occurred when starting the addon. The real
  error should be displayed in the logs above this line.

It is based on the work of [Xiaonan Shen][shenxn] who inspired this repository for the build

## Roadmap

Here are some ideas to improve this addon:

* Use a web interface to enter the 2nd factor code
* ~~Run the ProtonMail bridge in the background using Systemd (using this tutorial for 
  example https://gist.github.com/ibaiul/60d603845df931483a05d96c5b433981) or S6 overlay~~
  _**Done in version 1.3.0 using S6 overlay**_
* Create a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases] functionality.
* Exposes services to be able to interact with ProtonMail Bridge within Home Assistant
* Test this addon on other architectures _**Done for amd64 in version 1.2.0**_
* ~~Check if the ProtonMail password is in the `have i been pwned` database~~ _**Done in 
  version 1.2.0**_
* ~~Create an automated build to publish all images on Docker Hub when a new release
  is created~~ _**Done in version 1.2.0**_

## Testing on you local machine

→ Build the image in the ha-protonmail-bridge directory
```shell
docker build --build-arg BUILD_FROM="homeassistant/amd64-base:latest" -t local/my-test-addon .
```

→ Run built image
```shell
docker run --rm -v /tmp/my_test_data:/data -p 25:2525 local/my-test-addon
```

Inside the directory `my_test_data`, create a file called `options.json` with 
the correct configuration for the addon.

→ Start a shell in the image to debug
```shell
docker run --rm -v /tmp/my_test_data:/data -p 25:2525  -ti --entrypoint bash local/my-test-addon
```
